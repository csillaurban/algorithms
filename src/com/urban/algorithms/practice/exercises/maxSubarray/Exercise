Hackerrank exercise

We define subsequence as any subset of an array. We define a subarray as a contiguous subsequence in an array.

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

-all nonempty subarrays.
-all nonempty subsequences.
Print the two values as space-separated integers on one line.

Note that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

For example, given an array arr = [-1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 10], the maximum subarray sum is comprised
of element inidices [1-5]and the sum is 16.
The maximum subsequence sum is comprised of element indices  [1, 2, 4, 5] and the sum is 20.
